     <p class="introduction-p">hi, my name is Idan Shtivi and I am 24 years old.
        I live in Holon with my perfect wife Sahar Mizrahi on Shoshana-Damari street. I have a big, happy, beautiful family, 3 sisters, happily married parents and two dogs.
        <br>
        When I was a kid I always got into some trouble.<br>
        Not studying not in classes the corridor was the best friend.<br>
        After years of failing my final certificates, my parents gave up, the teachers gave up and me too, I was discouraged. And a second before I was kicked out of school
        They decided to put me in a project called Turnaround<br>
        This project is taking kids that the system intended to throw out.<br>
        With over 7 out of 8 failing a final certificate.<br>
        And there they taught me a very important thing<br>
        <br>
        Self-learning - teach me how to learn
        <br>
        From the child who fails to pass one test and almost flew out of school, I became a school graduate with 12 years of full matriculation and when no one believed in me, I believed
        <br>
        Today I can tell about myself that I am a curious person who likes to learn something new every day, the areas I have touched so far in my life are a little far from each other but you can always find the connection between them.

        <b>Music</b><br><br>
        From the age of 14 I learned how to make electronic music<br>
        At the age of 15 I already had my first performance<br>
        Until I was 18, I used to make music at home and play it at a party once a week<br>
        I got to the point where I have an hour and a half of my original music<br>
        I wanted to step up so I started posting it on social networks<br>
        Facebook Sound Cloud Twitter Instagram<br>
        And as time passed, more views, likes and shares began to arrive<br>
        Until I got to the point where most of my music has tens of thousands of views<br>
        <br>
        <b>Army</b><br><br>
        I enlisted in the army at the age of 18 straight after school.<br>
        I served for a year and a half in the technical formation of the Air Force Unit 108.<br>
        My department's specialty was soldering and sewing.<br>
        A meaningful, helpful, interesting, fun service.<br>
        During the service I acquired friends, knowledge was a significant and useful service and above all fun.<br><br>


        <b>kitchen</b><br><br>
        After the army to finance my music studies I started working in the kitchen.<br>
        I started at Endeavor Cafe, after that at r2m's bar, Herzl 16, Popa and Santa Katrina.<br>
        During the time I was in many positions.<br>
        Meat butcher, grill man, preparation cook, cold, hot, tabon<br>
        I learned a lot of cooking techniques and dealing with raw materials<br>
        And here, as in any field, there is never-ending learning<br>
        In the end I ended up managing the kitchen<br>
        Together with the two chefs we were led down a new path in the restaurant<br>
        An amazing time, a great experience full of knowledge<br>
        But it's time to say goodbye and start a new path<br><br> 

        <b>hobbies</b><br><br> 
        Part of the development of a profession is to start a hobby<br> 
        something you like,that you connect with, at least that's how it works for me.<br> 
        Today my hobbies are mainly learning new things for example<br>
        These days I am studying investments in the field of crypto and the stock exchange<br>
        Continues and invests time in learning about correct personal and financial conduct<br>
        I listen to a lot of podcasts about the topics that interest me<br>
        But mostly investing my time in a hobby that is first in my priority list which is<br>
        full stack diviloper My desire to work in the field and turn the hobby into a job<br>
